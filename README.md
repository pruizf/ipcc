# IPCC Corpus Analyses #

Some scripts to analyze several textual features of the [Reports](https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/publications_and_data_reports.shtml) by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

The scripts apply [Treetagger](http://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/TreeTagger/) and [CoreNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/) for part-of-speech tagging, besides finding occurrences of lists of terms created by a domain expert.
